#### Environment Setup
For development it is best to create a virtual environment. In order to do so you can use the built in Python `venv` module:

1. Change to `/server` directory: 
    ```
    cd server
    ``` 

2. Create virtual env: 
    ```
    python -m venv tech-hub
    ```

3. Activate env:
    1. Linux: `source tech-hub/bin/activate`
    2. Windows `.\tech-hub\Scripts\activate`

4. Deactivate env:
    ```
    deactivate
    ```
